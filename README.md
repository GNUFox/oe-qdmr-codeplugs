# OE QDMR Codeplugs

A Repository for DMR-Codeplugs for Austria (and neighbouring countries / regions).  
Using YAML Format readible by qdmr (https://dm3mat.darc.de/qdmr/).

**WARNING: There may be some errors. Work in Progress**

The `rt3s_gps_buttons.yaml` could work with other radios as well, I only tested it with a RETEVIS RT3S GPS.  
The `rd5r.yaml` is modified for the Baofeng RD-5R (or similar radios) as they can only store 16 channels per zone.
